======

## Submission Instructions
  * fork this repository & create a new branch for your work
  * push to your repository
  * submit a pull request to this repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

## Learning Objectives  
* students will learn how to save resource data to the file system for a layer of data persistence
* students will learn how to refactor commonly used coding constructs into custom helper modules

## Requirements

#### Configuration
* Reference the file structure of [this template](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401d23/tree/master/back-end/00-empty-template) for the configuration files you need and folder structure
* `README.md`
  * your `README.md` should include detailed instructions on how to use your API
  * this should include documentation on how to access your API endpoints

#### Feature Tasks
* continue working on your vanilla REST API
* refactor your routes to be contained in a separate module (ex: `route/resource-route.js`)
* refactor your `res` messages & status codes to be contained in a separate module (ex: `response.js`)
* refactor the `storage.js` module to use file system persistence
  * use the `fs` module to create and read the associated data files
  * the name of the file should contain the related resource id
